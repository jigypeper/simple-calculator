# Simple Calculator
The program asks the user to either enter a calculation, or choose a file to calculate from.

## How to use
Enter the data in a specific format:  
`number number operation`  

e.g.  
`10 10 +`

If you are calculating from an external file, ensure that the data is formatted in the same manner.
The CLI should notify you of any errors in the input files.
